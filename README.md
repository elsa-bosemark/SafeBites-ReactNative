# TO DO:

#### Elsa

- **fix ui**
- working on detail page
- dynamic open hours, call, directions
- navigation of profile page?
- location is wrong

#### Athena

- in progress profile screen : if ur not logged in, then the options to login/signup are shown. when u click the buttons it _sometimes_ works. when u type in info it _sometimes_ disappears. --> i'll fix it later
- favorites are now shown on the profile page. we have the data **but** it's still the huge list of data (when we originally got it its the `response.data.businesses`.) we still have to parse through it (takes _some_ time) and display it. (i was trying to do it but it kept crashing.)

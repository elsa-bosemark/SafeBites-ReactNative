- in progress profile screen : if ur not logged in, then the options to login/signup are shown. when u click the buttons it _sometimes_ works. when u type in info it _sometimes_ disappears. --> i'll fix it later
- make `Restaurant Detail`'s favorite, call, directions, and website buttons actually work

elsa 4 athena:

- make the login/guest/signup on profile screen not be a pop up but just part of the UI of the profile screen (might help with the bugs)
- when close the sign up pop up both pop ups close => it should only be the sign up pop up
- sign up sometimes doesn't work and when I was typing in the sign up fields it suddely closed
- there should be verication in sign up (like password must be 6 characters and have a special character and the email should have @)
- when made account the screen went blank => should a bunch of errors
- I can't sign into account
- People with accounts should only be allowed to access rate button => show pop up
- I can heart restaurants even tho Im not logged in => heart should turn red
- when I complete the rating my info doesn't show up (I'm not logged in fyi)
- the heart button on the restaraunt detail screen doesn't work
- when a rest doesn't have a safety score is should have ?/10 not 0/10

- should I get rid of the google rating?

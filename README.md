# TO DO:

#### Elsa

- **fix ui**
- dynamic open hours

#### Athena

- make the login/guest/sign up on profil screen not be a pop up but just part of the UI of the profile screen (might help with the bugs)

- in progress profile screen : if ur not logged in, then the options to login/signup are shown. when u click the buttons it _sometimes_ works. when u type in info it _sometimes_ disappears. --> i'll fix it later
- make `Restaurant Detail`'s favorite, call, directions, and website buttons actually work

## TO DO: 

#### Elsa
- **fix ui**
- working on detail page
 - dynamic open hours, call, directions
 - navigation of profile page?
- location is wrong

#### Athena 
- in progress profile screen : if ur not logged in, then the options to login/signup are shown. when u click the buttons it *sometimes* works. when u type in info it *sometimes* disappears. --> i'll fix it later
- favorites are now shown on the profile page. but, since we're using the `Restaurant Card` component, i haven't quite been able to get the data for it yet (showing the delivery, price, and distance).

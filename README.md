# TO DO:

#### Elsa

- **fix ui**
- dynamic open hours
- fix home screen scrolling

#### Athena

- in progress profile screen : if ur not logged in, then the options to login/signup are shown. when u click the buttons it _sometimes_ works. when u type in info it _sometimes_ disappears. --> i'll fix it later
- make `Restaurant Detail` directions, and website buttons actually work
- i'm not _too_ sure if the call buttons works or not. you'd have to run it on a real device; it won't work on the simulator. but i'm pretty sure it should work.

##### elsa 4 athena:

- when I complete the rating my info doesn't show up (I'm not logged in fyi)
